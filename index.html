                <p>üå∏ Happy Mother's Day in Advance, Mum ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                <p>Before the world celebrates you, I want to be among the first to say: Thank you, Mama. Thank you for everything.</p>
                <p>You are not just my mother ‚Äî you are my friend, my mentor, my prayer warrior, my advisor, and the voice of reason in every storm. Your words have guided me. Your prayers have protected me. Your strength has lifted me. Your love has molded me. And your faith has inspired me to be better every single day.</p>
                <p>You correct me when I go wrong, but with love. You advise me not just in the things of this world, but in the things of the Spirit. You have been there for me when I had no words, only tears ‚Äî and somehow, you always understood.</p>
                <p>But truthfully, no amount of money could ever repay the value of your love, wisdom, or sacrifice. It's not much, Mama, not compared to all you've done and continue to do for me... but it comes from the deepest part of my heart.</p>
                <p>I love you more than words can express. You are a blessing I can never take for granted. May God bless you abundantly, just as you've blessed me all my life.</p>
                <p class="signature">Your loving son,<br>Trust Muhau Mwendabai</p>
